This project was created as a part of two day Hackathon at NITH. This project serves as a Online college Registration System , where students can upload their pdf files of payment receipt.
For the backend , we have created a Desktop app , in which we are reading the  DU number from the uploaded pdf's and cross checking those DU numbers with the excel file generated by the account statement of bank !! 
After all the checks , result is then uploaded on website , about the verification of the student .
